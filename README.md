# Big O Notation
# It helps determine the efficiency of an algorithm


# Order of Growth
# O(1)          -   constant        (best)
# O(log n)      -   logarithmic
# O(n)          -   linear
# O(n log n)    -   linearithmic
# O(n^2)        -   quadratic
# O(n^3)        -   cubic
# O(2^n)        -   exponential
# O(n!)         -   factorial       (worse)
# NB: basically, the efficiency of the algorithm(function) decreases down the order.
